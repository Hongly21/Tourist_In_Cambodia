                    local tour guide and get transferred to hotel. After check in the hotel, enjoy your time at your
                    leisure.
                    The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Luang Prabang is perhaps the best-preserved traditional city
                    in Southeast Asia. The perfect combination of tranquility, splendid natural scenery and cultural
                    sights makes it one of the most delightful places to visit in Laos. <br>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Following breakfast at the hotel, you will first visit the former King’s Palace, which is now the
                    National Museum. The many items nicely displayed include rare furniture, traditional costumes and
                    arts, jewelry, ornaments as well as working tools and utensils of the early part of the 20th
                    century. Then, drive out of town to Ban Xanghai, known as the whisky village where the local make
                    their wine lao lao from rice. Next, you will walk down to the pier to board a local motorized boat
                    heading along Mekong to the mysterious Pak Ou Caves to explore these mysterious caverns, filled with
                    thousands of gold-lacquered Buddha images. <br>
                    Later, on the way back to Luang Prabang you will visit Ban Xieng Khong and Ban Xieng Lek which are
                    very famous for making Saa Jute paper. <br>
                    On arrival in town in the late afternoon, join us on a climb up to Phousi Hill – the highest point
                    in the area, to admire the panoramic view of the town at sunset. Transfer back to the hotel and
                    enjoy your easy time afterward. <br>
                    In the evening, you can either relax in the hotel or explore the nearby Night Market on your own,
                    where you can find an expansive collection of textiles, hand-woven by the local hill tribe people.
                    Meals: Breakfast. <br>

                    <p>* Optional tour with surcharge: For the early risers, we suggest you should participate in the
                        daily morning rituals of saffron-clad monks collecting offerings of Alms (ubiquitous sticky
                        rice) from the faithful residents. This tradition is very unique in Laos, being the only
                        Buddhist nation still preserving the procession. <br>
                        After breakfast, take a half day city tour with us to explore the city’s main attractions. Start
                        your day with the visit to the local morning market named Phosi Market, where you will see such
                        diverse offerings such as dried buffalo skin, local tea and saltpeter among the chickens,
                        vegetables and hill-tribe weaving. Continue the temple exploration at Wat Visoun, the site of
                        the impressive Thad Makmo stupa. The rounded dome is stylistically more Sinhalese than Lao. Move
                        to Wat Mai, which was built in 1796. Its five-tiered roof of the wooden Sim (chapel) epitomizes
                        the graceful Luang Prabang architectural style. End your visit at Wat Xieng Thong, the Golden
                        City Monastery, which dates back to the 16th century and is considered to be the finest temple
                        in Laos. <br>
                        In the afternoon, transfer to the airport to catch the flight to Siem Reap, the provincial
                        capital and gateway to the ancient Angkor temples. Recognized as a World Heritage Site by
                        UNESCO, the Angkor Archaeological Park encompasses dozens of temple ruins including Bayon,
                        Banteay Srei and the legendary Angkor Wat. Upon arrival, you will be welcomed by local tour

                            largest Khmer temple and finest example of Angkorian art and architecture. <br>
                            Have the packed breakfast then set back out on the tour to visit the jungle-entwined temple,
                            Ta Prohm. From there you will proceed to Angkor Thom’s imposing South Gate, topped with the
                            four serenely smiling faces of Avalokiteshvara. Next, visit Bayon Temple, the Elephant
                            Terrace and the Terrace of the Leper King. <br>
                            Enjoy a lunch of traditional Khmer cuisine served at the home of a local. <br>
                            After lunch we drive to Banteay Srei, regarded as the women’s citadel and home to Angkor’s
                            finest stone carvings. Your trip continues to Preah Khan (Sacred Sword): one of Angkor’s
                            largest temples, constructed in the 12th century by Jayavarman VII. Later this afternoon,
                            you will return to the hotel where you will spend your time on your own. <br>

                            hidden temples outside of Siem Reap. The mystical overgrown Beng Mealea and the
                            pyramid-shaped Koh Ker are located in the Cambodian countryside within a short drive from
                            Siem Reap. Koh Ker – the former capital of the Khmer Empire under the reign of Jayavarman
                            IV, now is abandoned deep in the jungle. There are many structures inside Koh Ker, but the
                            most outstanding temple is seven-tiered pyramid Prasat Thom. <br>
                            On the way back to Siem Reap, continue on to visit the incredible jungle-covered temple:
                            Beng Mealea. This distant temple is a gem in the midst of the jungle; half strangled with
                            vines and decorated by lichen, Beng Mealea is the true adventure experience. <br>

                            After dining on your creations, transfer out of town to Tonle Sap Lake – the largest

                            in Phnom Penh. We will see a “floating village” – boats have been converted to look like
