            library. The innermost enclosure contains the main sanctuary, which has five towers arranged in a quincunx

            the top of a
            525-metre (1,722 ft) cliff in the Dângrêk Mountains, in the Preah Vihear province, Cambodia. The temple is
            dedicated to Shiva, one of the main Hindu gods, and features a series of sanctuaries linked by a system of
            pavements and staircases over an 800 metre long axis. The temple dates back to the 11th century AD, but its
            complex history can be traced to the 9th century, when the hermitage was founded. The temple is a
            masterpiece of Khmer architecture and art, with exquisite carvings and sculptures depicting scenes from
            Hindu mythology and history. The temple also offers breathtaking views of the plain of Cambodia, which is

            challenge of climbing the steep and narrow stairs to reach the temple, and explore the surrounding natural
            environment. History buffs can discover the fascinating and turbulent history of the temple, which has been
            a source of dispute and conflict between Cambodia and Thailand for decades. In 1962, the International Court
            of Justice ruled that the temple belongs to Cambodia, and in 2008, the temple was listed as a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site. However, the border dispute remains unresolved, and the temple is sometimes closed to
            visitors due to security reasons. <br> <br>
            Preah Vihear Temple is one of the best places to visit in Cambodia, as it showcases the glory and the
