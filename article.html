            The Apsara costume is a traditional style of dress for the female dancers who perform the Apsara dance, a
            classical Khmer art form that portrays the heavenly nymphs of Hindu and Buddhist mythology. The costume
            features a silk skirt, a sash, a bodice, and a jeweled headdress. The skirt has pleats and patterns, the
            sash hangs over one shoulder, the bodice is snug and embroidered, and the headdress is conical or

        <h1 style="color: orange;">Traditional Khmer textiles</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 1.3em;
        line-height: 30px;">
            Traditional Khmer textiles are a form of art and craft that have been practiced in Cambodia for thousands of
            years. They are made from silk or cotton, using techniques such as weaving, dyeing, and embroidery. These
            textiles are not only beautiful, but also meaningful, as they reflect the culture, history, and identity of
            the Khmer people. <br> <br>
            The most common type of traditional Khmer textile is the sampot, a wrap-around skirt that is worn by both
            men and women. The sampot can have various patterns and colors, depending on the occasion and the social
            status of the wearer. The most elaborate sampot is the sampot hol, which is made from silk and features
            intricate designs created by the ikat technique. Ikat is a method of dyeing the warp threads before weaving,
            resulting in a blurred and complex pattern on the fabric. <br> <br> Another type of traditional Khmer
            textile is the pidan, a ceremonial wall hanging that is used in Buddhist temples. The pidan is also made
            from silk and ikat, but the designs are more elaborate and symbolic, depicting scenes from the life of
            Buddha or the legends of the Khmer Empire. The pidan is considered to be a sacred object, and is often
            donated to the temples by the faithful. <br> <br> Traditional Khmer textiles are not only a form of art, but
            also a source of livelihood for many Cambodians. The silk industry in Cambodia has faced many challenges,
            such as war, poverty, and competition, but it has also been revived and supported by various initiatives,
            such as the Institute for Khmer Traditional Textiles (IKTT), which was founded by a Japanese master kimono
            painter, Kikuo Morimoto. The IKTT aims to preserve and promote the ancient heritage of Khmer textiles, by
            training young weavers, cultivating natural dyes, and restoring the natural forest. <br> <br>Traditional
            Khmer textiles are a treasure of Cambodia, and a testament to the skill and creativity of the Khmer
            artisans. They are a way of expressing and celebrating the rich and diverse culture of the Khmer people, and
            a way of connecting to their past and future.
